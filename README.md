# image-refocalization
This project is a proof of concept with synthetic data of how it may be possible to enhance the resolution of telescope images of distant galaxies using denoising convolutional neural networks.

I have tried several techniques, the most promising is possibly the use of transfer learning (VGG16 model) toghether with custom convolutional layers.
